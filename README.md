Documenting my journey from Finance to Data Science.

This repository is a roadmap consisting my learnings on data science, machine learning, and AI skills.

I dedicate average 12 hours per week to improving my technical skills. This roadmap helps me stay accountable, and provides transparency on the things I learned and future plans for recruiters and collaborators.

**Categories:**
1. Foundations (Python + Math)
- Python fundamentals
- Statistics & linear algebra

2. Machine Learning
- Supervised learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Trees, XGBoost)
- Unsupervised learning (Clustering, PCA, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation & ML pipelines

3. Deep Learning
- Neural networks
- Training techniques (dropout, normalization)

4. AI
- Prompt Engineering
- Building Agents
